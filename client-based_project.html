            Overview: I’ve worked in a team with 
            3 others to help our client with project 
            management processes. Our team did preliminary 
            research to better understand the problem that 
            our client was facing. We conducted interviews 
            with employees from various teams. By creating 
            an affinity wall, our team thought about various 
            solutions that we could present to the client towards 
            the end of the semester. An important note: our client 
            has requested to remain anonymous.

            The Problem: 
            Our client needed help with optimizing their workflow 
            in the remote setting. They informed us that it 
            is important for them to improve 
            their project management process to help with 
            efficiency and break down silos to ensure that 
            people can find the information that they need 
            with ease. Our client wants to refine their 
            existing process so that they can move forward 
            with better practices. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            The Goal: 
        Our goal as a team was to provide useful 
        recommendations to our client that will 
        improve their workflow/project management 
        process. 
        </p>

            My Role:
            I was part of a team that consisted of 
            4 people including myself for a semester-long project 
            with a client that must remain anonymous. I took 
            part in all stages of the process such as 
            conducting research, interviewing employees, 
            creating an affinity wall, and brainstorming 
            solutions to help our client.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Research: 
            The ALEK Consulting Team conducted individual 
            background research reports in which we synthesized 
            research about our client. These reports covered 
            different topics. My report focused on understanding 
            project management. This encompasses its benefits, how 
            to wok in virtual teams, understanding common mistakes 
            with project management/communication, and ways to improve 
            project management. The research I did helped me get a better 
            understanding of the problem that our client faced. Additionally, 
            it helped me to begin thinking of possible solutions to help the client.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Interviews: 
            The ALEK Consulting Team had the privilege of conducting interviews 
            with eight individuals who contribute to the blogs. These contacts worked 
            in Marketing, Administration, Public Relations, and Web and were selected 
            with the help of our primary contact. These interviews gave us the opportunity 
            to ask questions and to see the workflow in action. We gathered useful data to 
            help us create affinity notes. Then turn those affinity notes into an affinity 
            wall. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Findings:
            We found that communication is confined to 
            individual teams. There are communication silos 
            across teams that lead to workflow inefficiencies. 
            We also found that there is little enforcement of 
            platform (Trello) usage. 
            Lastly, our team found that Trello is not used in 
            an effective way. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Solutions:
            <br>
            The ALEK Consulting Team provided a variety of recommendations 
            that will be useful to our client based on our contextual 
            analysis. I’ll list a few below. 
            <ul>
            <li> Adopt a centralized communication platform (Slack specifically)</li>
            <li> Formulate a “Trello Etiquette” by mandating Trello training so 
                that everyone knows how to use Trello and standardize the 
                information put into Trello Cards​</li>
            <li> Introduce a centralized archive to reduce the duplication of blog content</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>
